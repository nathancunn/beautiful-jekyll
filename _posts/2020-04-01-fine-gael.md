There's been one thing dominating my Twitter feed lately, popping up everywhere no matter how much I try to avoid it. I'm talking, of course, about the army of Twitter bots that Fine Gael have employed to post positive responses to each of their tweets.
According to the many experts on Twitter, Fine Gael are primarily concerned with optics and believe that a few positive comments under their tweets will be sufficient to shaping the electorate's opinion of them than their actual handling of COVID19.

The conspiracy isn't just confined to the darkened corners of the internet, with some journalists even espousing it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Even Twitterâ€™s bots and sock puppets are putting on the green jersey to support the government. <br><br>Read the 20+ supportive comments beneath this and then note their join date, followers, handles with numbers etc. <a href="https://t.co/3PMqcDkZNL">https://t.co/3PMqcDkZNL</a></p>&mdash; Philip Boucher-Hayes (@boucherhayes) <a href="https://twitter.com/boucherhayes/status/1244886271710892039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most of those making the claim give some variation of the following as their criteria for deeming an account to be FG bot:
  - Recent join date
  - No profile picture
  - An account handle ending with a series of numbers
  - Few followers

A cursory glance at the replies under the Simon Harris tweet do indeed turn up a number of such accounts, so the evidence feels compelling. However, I find the whole thing extremely cynical, an easy way to just rubbish off the opinions of anyone with whom you disagree. Regardless, given the added gravitas we pay to the opinions of journalists, shouldn't we expect that such claims be accompanied with some actual, non-anecdotal evidence?

I analysed just under 4,500 replies made to tweets from @SimonHarrisTD. I gathered the data using the great R package `rtweet`. The data gathered includes, among many other things, account join dates, profile picture URLs, Twitter handles, follower counts, and the text of the replies.
I identify as bots any accounts who satisfy any of the following:
  - Joined in the previous 90 days
  - Have no profile picture (their profile picture is recorded as `default_profile_normal.png`)
  - Have a Twitter handle ending in three or more digits
  - Have 10 or fewer followers
  - Satisfy any of the above criteria

I create these flags as follows:

``` r
harris_tweets %>%
  mutate(number_flag = str_detect(screen_name, ".+[0-9]{3}$"),
         avatar_flag = str_detect(profile_image_url, "default_profile_normal.png"),
         follower_flag = followers_count <= 10,
         date_flag = lubridate::now() - account_created_at <= 90,
         bot_flag = number_flag | avatar_flag | date_flag | follower_flag)

```

In order to gauge how positive or negative each of the replies was, I used the R package `tidytext` to measure the sentiment of each tweet. A basic description of this approach is that each word is assigned a score from -5 to +5, from very negative to very positive using the `AFINN` lexicon. The overall sentiment of a tweet is then the sum of these values for every word in the tweet.


``` r
harris_tweets %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) %>%
  group_by(status_id) %>%
  summarise(sent = sum(value)) %>%
  inner_join(harris_tweets)
```


Before reading on, I would recommend you consider what you expect to be the output of this analysis. How pervasive do you believe the Fine Gael bots are? How much more positive are their responses than those from everyone else? What evidence would it take for you to change your mind?


## How pervasive are the bots?
Having identified candidates for bots, what proportion of the replies to @SimonHarrisTD are actually from these candidates? If we expect that the positive comments are mostly coming from bots, and that our definition of a bot identifies bots accurately, then we should expect a greater proportion of those making positive comments to satisfy one or more of the criteria. However, there's very little difference between the two. In fact, the data suggest that accounts leaving negative tweets are slightly more likely to satisfy at least one of the bot criteria.

## Are the bots more positive?
A slightly different way of looking at this would be to ask: do the bots behave differently from us? Do they heap their praise more readily on FG than do the rest of us? You might expect these bot accounts to be much more glowing in their replies. Perhaps there are also anti-FG bots who are constantly replying with negative comments? In which case, you might expect the bots to make much more polarised tweets.

However, the accounts identified as bots because their Twitter handles end in multiple digits behave almost exactly the same as the other accounts:

As do accounts with no profile picture:

And the same holds for accounts matching _any_ of the bot criteria:

There's also no evidence that these bot accounts have been created more recently than other accounts:

## Why all the suspicious accounts then?
So, if there's no conspiracy happening, then why is everyone so suspicious? The pretext of the conspiracy is ludicrous: Fine Gael have invested money in bot Twitter accounts capable of generating grammatically correct and contextually sensible messages of support, but can only generate cookie cutter Twitter handles, can't add profile pictures and aren't capable of following each other. Not only that, but Fine Gael ramped up their efforts to do so _after_ a general election and during a global pandemic (apparently in case people turn over to team coronavirus).

The real reason for the suspicious Twitter handles is much more benign: *when you are setting up a Twitter account, Twitter never asks you to choose a Twitter handle*. Instead, you are asked your name and your email/mobile number and Twitter then generates your account. It automatically assigns you a handle consisting of the first seven letters of your name, followed by a sequence of eight random digits.

The reason for all the recently created accounts with no profile pictures, on the other hand, is a little more troubling, as anyone who has had to suffer an onslaught of awful memes from their parents will be well aware: older generations are discovering Twitter. With the current global situation, older generations are having to become familiar with newer technology to keep in touch with their family and to keep up-to-date with current developments. Many of these older people will follow the likes of Simon Harris, and are probably more inclined to be FG advocates already.

So, don't just offhandedly dismiss any positive comments under tweets from FG. Is it possible that they have bots making positive comments under their tweets? Absolutely. But, based on the criteria people are working with at the minute, the evidence is not particularly compelling. It's much more likely that there's been a surge on Twitter of accounts from the demographics who traditionally support the two big parties in Ireland, not to mention the number of people who recognise the good job they're currently doing. It doesn't mean they've forgiven them for any previous missteps, but they recognise the immense difficulty of their current positions and appreciate that they are giving it their best.
