Hi! I'm a PhD student studying statistics in the University of Warwick, a member of the Oxford-Warwick statistics programme (OxWaSP).

I'm originally from Donegal (Ireland), but I spent a number of years living and working in Dublin before starting on the PhD.

This blog will hopefully be a collection of the most trivial data analysis I can think of to avoid doing real work.
