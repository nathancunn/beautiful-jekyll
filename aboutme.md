Hi! I'm a PhD student studying statistics in the University of Warwick, a member of the Oxford-Warwick statistics programme (OxWaSP). My research focuses on developing the means of integrative cluster analysis for genomic data applications. I am currently based in the Alan Turing Institute in the British Library.
