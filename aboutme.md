Hi! I'm a PhD student studying statistics in the University of Warwick, a member of the Oxford-Warwick statistics programme (OxWaSP). I'm currently based in the Alan Turing Institute in the British Library.

My research focuses on developing the means of integrative cluster analysis for genomic data applications, but I'll mostly be using this blog to write about the sort of stuff nobody would ever pay me to write about, mostly The Simpsons.
