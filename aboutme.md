title: About me

Hi! I'm a PhD student in Warwick University, a member of the Oxford-Warwick statistics programme (OxWaSP). Currently, I'm based in the Alan Turing Institute in the British Library. My research focuses on developing means of integrative cluster analysis in the context of genomic data analysis. Simply put, I am developing ways of uncovering groups in data while taking in information from multiple data sources.

Prior to my PhD I worked in the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) in Dublin analysing national health data.

I'll mostly be using this blog to write about the sort of stuff nobody would ever pay me to write about, more often than not The Simpsons.
