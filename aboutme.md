Hi! I'm a PhD student studying statistics in the University of Warwick, a member of the Oxford-Warwick statistics programme (OxWaSP).

I'm originall from Donegal (Ireland), but spent a number of years living and working in Dublin before starting on the PhD.

This blog will hopefully be a collection of the most trivial data analysis I can waste my time on.
