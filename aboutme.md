title: About me
---


Hi! I'm a PhD student in Warwick University, a member of the Oxford-Warwick statistics programme (OxWaSP). My PhD has taken me around a few institutions: Oxford, Warwick, The Alan Turing Institute, but currently I'm based in Dublin. 

My research focuses on developing means of integrative cluster analysis in the context of genomic data analysis. Simply put, I am researching ways of finding groups in data where these data may arise from multiple sources. The application area of this is analysing the broad array of genetic data recorded on patients in order to identify risk cohorts.

Prior to my PhD I worked in the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) in Dublin analysing national health data.

I'll mostly be using this blog to write about the sort of stuff nobody would ever pay me to write about, more often than not The Simpsons.
